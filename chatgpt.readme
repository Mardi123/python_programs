Python Code Generator using OpenAI API
This Python script prompts the user for a query, and generates a Python code snippet using OpenAI's GPT model. The generated code is then saved to a file specified by the user.

Getting Started
To use this script, you'll need an API key from OpenAI. You can sign up for an API key here.

You can also clone the repository from Github and run the script locally. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git
cd [repository-name]
python code_generator.py [prompt] [file_name]
Replace [username] and [repository-name] with your Github username and the name of your repository, respectively.

[prompt] is the prompt or query that you want to generate Python code for.

[file_name] is the name of the file that you want to save the generated code to.

Prerequisites
You'll need to install the following packages:

requests
argparse
You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests argparse
Usage
To use the script, simply run it with Python and provide the prompt and file name as command-line arguments:

bash
Copy code
python code_generator.py "How to print 'Hello, World!' in Python?" hello_world.py
This will prompt the GPT model to generate Python code for printing "Hello, World!" to the console, and save the generated code to a file named hello_world.py.

Acknowledgements
This script was inspired by the OpenAI API documentation, which can be found here.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
